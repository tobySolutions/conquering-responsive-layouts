Review of the first week


In this first week, we've looked at:

1. Using percentages for widths
2. Avoiding to set heights
3. Using max-width

While there is nothing overly complicated with any of that, being comfortable with these things is the key to mastering responsive layouts.

With a good understanding of the above, all we need is a little flexbox and we're going to start knocking even complex layouts out of the park!

In this section of the course, you can find a few links to some extra reading that you can do if you're looking to continue learning a bit. They'll help supplement what we're covering here, but none of it is required reading ðŸ˜Š.

I'll be sharing my solution to the challenge tomorrow. If you're a little bit behind at this point, you can use today and tomorrow to catch up a little.

Next week, we'll be jumping into flexbox and how we can use it with what we've already learned to make our layouts. We'll be looking at both the macro-scale with a page's layout, as well as the more micro-scale in putting together a common navbar component.
