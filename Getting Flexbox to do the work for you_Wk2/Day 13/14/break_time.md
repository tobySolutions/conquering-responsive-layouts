# Break time!

 **There are no new lessons or content this weekend** . We've covered a lot over the last 2-weeks, and while I might be sounding like a broken record at this point, it's important to have some down-time. It also gives people who are a little behind a chance to catch-up a little ðŸ˜Š.

So if you're in catch-up mode, take your time over this weekend to do so, and if you're all caught up, or maybe just working on the challenge, that's great!

 **We'll be back at it on Monday when we start looking at media queries** .

 **
If you're insistent on finding something new to learn about** , over on YouTube I have [**a video that takes a look at some relatively new CSS functions**](https://youtu.be/U9VF-4euyRo):

* min()
* max()
* and clamp()

They are some exciting functions that we can use as for the values of elements, so we could set something like `width: min(95%, 1200px);`, which would be the same as setting both a width and a max-width.

And while setting a width and max-width is something we could already do, we can also use this for things like margin and padding (and font sizes!), where something like that wasn't even possible before.

Clamp() is even more exciting in how we could use it for responsive typography.

I'm still scratching the surface with these, and browser support for them (especially clamp()) isn't perfect yet, but they open up some exciting possibilities for creating responsive websites!
